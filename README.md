# CNNHome-Partition by Çağrı Asan
This project aims to develop a CNN-based model for predicting certain parts of a house. By leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model will be trained on a dataset of house images annotated with different room labels. The goal is to accurately segment and predict the various sections of a house, such as the frontal, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.

You can change the architecture, epoch value, optimization function and keras metrics used in the model according to your project.
